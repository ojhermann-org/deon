# okf-tools — repo guide for Claude

A Cargo workspace holding three crates: **`okf-graph`** and **`okf-normative`**,
two general-purpose tools for validating an [OKF][okf] Knowledge Bundle, and
**`deon`**, the archived reference implementation they supersede.

The architecture — how these crates relate to `pacioli`, to the Knowledge
Bundles, and to the applied accounting agent — lives in the README of the
[`okf-stack` project board][board]. Read it before making structural decisions.
It is a working reference, not a settled spec, and it is edited as work
proceeds; per-repo authoritative documentation replaces it as each repo is
built out.

## The crates, and the boundary between them

- **`okf-graph` — topology and identity.** What Concepts exist, what they are
  called, what points at what, what resolves and what dangles. Node bodies are
  carried as **opaque payloads** and never interpreted here.
- **`okf-normative` — semantics.** The normative reading: the mechanical /
  judgment / election cut, grounding, coverage, conflict, defeat, termination
  at the seam. Consumes a validated graph; never re-parses a Bundle.
- **`deon` — archived.** Kept as reference, `publish = false`. See below.

**`okf-normative` depends on `okf-graph`, never the reverse.** Inside a
workspace it costs nothing to violate that, so it has to be deliberate: no
reaching around through dev-dependencies, and `okf-graph`'s tests must not
mention a color, a norm, or anything normative. The falsifiable version: **if
`okf-graph`'s test suite cannot be read by someone who has never heard of
deontic logic, the boundary is not real.**

The split exists so the halves are independently testable — normative rules
against in-memory graphs, with no files and no OKF — and so assumptions about
an unsettled format stay quarantined in one crate. It is **not** a plugin
architecture: there is one evaluation today, and no second one can yet be
named.

## Scope: the tools, not the knowledge

Neither tool is accounting-specific, and neither is an authority on any domain.
Norm *content* lives in Knowledge Bundles elsewhere — one per authority (GAAP,
IFRS, …), authored and reviewed by domain experts. `crates/deon/examples/`
holds three seed norms as **fixtures**, not as a catalog to grow.

Two limits follow, and both matter more than they look:

- **Fidelity is not machine-checkable.** Nothing here verifies that a Bundle
  faithfully represents the standard it claims to encode. Structural validation
  plus a machine author yields a Bundle that is well-formed, fully cited,
  internally consistent, and wrong. Expert review is the gate; say so rather
  than implying otherwise.
- **Declaration, not derivation.** The checker verifies an author was
  internally *consistent* about the seam. It cannot verify that a predicate
  declared `mechanical` deserves the colour — that needs domain knowledge these
  tools deliberately do not hold.

## The core discipline

Every predicate is **colored** — `mechanical` (decidable from seam data),
`judgment` (open-textured, must cite where it grounds), or `election` (a
discretionary entity choice, grounding in entity policy). The invariant, stated
once: **anything that could fall on either side of the seam must say which**,
and silence is a defect rather than a default.

`okf-normative` inherits two commitments from `deon`:

- **A ledger with a checker, not an inference engine.** Normative input comes
  from expert users; agents assist, they do not decide. Whether something is
  mechanical is a standard-setter's policy choice, not a discoverable property.
- **Deriving is not inferring.** Computing an interior node's colour from
  expert-declared leaves is arithmetic over declarations, and is on the table —
  it is what would let the checker *catch* a mis-colouring rather than merely
  notice two declarations disagreeing.

## The archived `deon` crate

It stays a **live workspace member** rather than an excluded directory: its
fixtures and 27 tests are a behavioural specification worth running as a
baseline while the new crates are built. An excluded crate rots; a green one
stays useful.

- Keep it compiling and green. Do **not** extend it, add checks to it, or build
  new work on it.
- Do **not** delete it or its fixtures without asking.
- Its **docs are not archived with it.** `docs/DESIGN.md`, the two
  `docs/spikes/` notes, and `docs/probes/` are the intellectual record the new
  crates inherit — the seam, the colouring model, N1, F5, the grounding
  discipline. Only the implementation is superseded.

## Build and verify

- **Run it:** `nix run . -- crates/deon/examples/` for the always-on checks;
  add `--okf <bundle>` for the two needing a concept bundle (GROUND-3 anchor
  resolution, and coverage, which reads each subject's declared state space).
  The repo ships usable bundles under `crates/deon/tests/fixtures/`.
- **Test:** `cargo test --workspace`. Every check ships a green case (the
  seeds) and a red fixture, because a checker you have only seen say "clean" is
  not a checker. The `near-miss` and `claim-shapes` fixtures cover the
  *near-miss* forms specifically — this codebase's characteristic bug is a
  shape that parses, passes, and is silently never examined.
- **CI:** `nix flake check` is the single required status check on `main`
  (`.github/rulesets/main.json`, reconciled by `scripts/settings.sh`). It gates
  `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, and the suite.
- **Docs lint at 80 columns**, and emphasis style must be *consistent within
  each file* (MD049 infers it from the first use — `docs/DESIGN.md` is
  underscore, this file is asterisk). Both bite often.

## Comments

Comments enhance the code; they do not narrate it. This repo argues for its
designs in prose, which is easy to mistake for licence to write a lot — it is
not. Say what has to be said, as succinctly as it can be said.

- **Keep the reasoning a reader cannot recover** from the code or the spec: why
  a type omits a field, why a defective input must still parse, why two
  different inputs deliberately give the same answer, what was rejected.
- **Cut restatement** of the spec, narration of what the code plainly does, and
  the rhetorical tail on a point already made.
- **Put a rationale on the item whose behaviour it explains**, not in the module
  header. One line for an obvious accessor or test; a paragraph only where a
  decision was made.

## Landing changes

- `main` is **PR-only** and branch-protected (required owner review + merge
  queue). `scripts/merge.sh <pr>` lands an owner-authored PR via ruleset
  bypass — the agent runs it **only on the owner's explicit ask for that PR**.
  Asking for a task is not an ask to merge the PRs the task produces; the
  required review is exactly the gate the bypass removes. This applies to any
  sub-agent you brief, which will act on whatever authority your brief claims
  for it.
- `merge.sh` gates on green CI, so no `--force` is needed; **`--force` stays
  owner-run/confirm-first.**

## Deletion & creation

- Do **not** weaken the colouring discipline, and do not let a rule's
  *recognition* depend on the thing that rule checks for — an aggregation that
  stops being an aggregation when you delete its citation is how a checker gets
  weaker exactly as its input gets more dishonest.
- Do **not** add an execution engine, a bespoke syntax, or neural components.
  Evaluation belongs to the applied project; that is a layer boundary now, not
  a deferral.
- Treat `docs/` as the load-bearing record of *why* things are shaped as they
  are, including what was rejected. Don't casually rewrite it.
- Where the OKF format fights us, **log the concrete case when it happens** — an
  eventual conversation with that community should rest on a dated list of real
  friction, not recollection. Taking anything upstream is the owner's call.
