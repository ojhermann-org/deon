//! An OKF **concept document** ([SPEC §4][spec]): one markdown file, read as a
//! YAML [`Frontmatter`] block and a markdown [`Body`]. Those two parts are the
//! whole model.
//!
//! No **concept id**: §2 defines it as the file's path within the bundle, which
//! is a fact about the bundle rather than the document. Identity belongs to
//! whatever loads one.
//!
//! **Parse leniently, judge strictly.** §9 requires consumers to tolerate a
//! missing optional field, an unknown `type`, an unknown extra key, a broken
//! link — so parsing fails only where the two parts cannot be told apart, never
//! over what the frontmatter says. A concept with no `type` fails conformance
//! and still parses: a checker that cannot build a defective document cannot
//! report anything located about it.
